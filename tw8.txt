TERMWORK 8:  Simulate a simple 5G Network application using NS3. 
 
Step 1 : Open UBUNTU and locate and open ns-allinone-3.28 folder on Desktop. 
Step 2 : Go to ns-3.28 folder and open examples->tutorial->second.cc 
Step 3 : Copy second.cc and paste it in ns-3.28->scratch folder. 
Remember that scratch folder should contain only one .cc example file and it must contain scratch executable file named scratchsimulator.cc and other files can be deleted.
Step 4 :  In third.cc , include the following code. (Before – “Simulator::Run ();”) 
 	 	#include “ns3/netanim-module.h” 
  		AnimationInterface anim("third, xml");     
AsciiTraceHelper ascii; 
   	 	pointToPoint.EnableAsciiAll(ascii.CreateFileStream("third.tr"));    	 			pointToPoint.EnablePcapAll("third"); 
Step 5 : Right click->Open in terminal and change working directory to Desktop by cd Desktop and type following commands to go to location where scratch executable file is located i.e. scratch folder. 
Step 6 : cd ns-allinone-3.28     ->    cd ns-3.28
Step 7 :		 ./waf build
Step 8 : Run the third.cc by entering following command. 
 	 	./waf --run scratch/third
Step 9 : Once build is successful, 
cd ../ (return to ns-allinone-3.28 folder)
ls
cd netanim-3.108 ( enter into netanim-3.108)
Step 10 : Now to see the animation, 
./NetAnim  (we have to open NetAnim software) 
Step 11 : In NetAnim, open third , xml by clicking on open XML trace file icon. 
Step 12 : Click on run option/icon to see the animation. To see the packet transfer, open Packets Tab.
